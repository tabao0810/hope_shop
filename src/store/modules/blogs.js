          text: "If you are a Vietnamese then it’s a pity when you haven’t been to Halong Bay once in your life. Last year I went on a trip to Ha Long with my family. To make the trip more interesting, my dad drove a family car himself to bring everyone here. It was a beautiful day. The blue sky and white clouds made me even more nervous. We sat in the car and sang songs together. Half a day, we arrived. We rent a room at Muong Thanh hotel. This is a 5 star hotel so the service is extremely good. The staff here welcomed us very enthusiastically. We rent two rooms. A room for my parents and a room for me and my brother. Our room has full TV, air conditioner, refrigerator, … very comfortable. After checking in, we went out to enjoy a bit of the sea breeze. The air here is very fresh and cool. We rented a tram to take a tour of the place. Ha Long’s scenery made us all in awe. Looking back from a distance, Ha Long is like a majestic picture. There are many islands and caves here. There are Dau Go cave, Thien Cung cave, Trong Mai island … and rich vegetation. Together we watched the long sand beaches and ships peeked out in the distance. We passed the shops that were sparkling with lights. When we were tired, we returned to the hotel for dinner and rest to prepare for the next day with exciting experiences. The next morning I got up early to catch the dawn. Today my brother and I had fun at the water park playing adventure. My trip to Ha Long was very fun and enjoyable. We have a lot of commemorative photos here. I will be back here this summer.",
